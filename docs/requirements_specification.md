# Requirements Specification: Texty - AI Text Enhancement PWA

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Texty Progressive Web App (PWA).

## 2. Functional Requirements

*   **Core Text Enhancement:**
    *   The PWA shall allow users to enhance text using AI models.
    *   The PWA shall offer enhancement options: Add Context, Expand Details, Clarify, Professional Tone, Creative Flair.
    *   The PWA shall support Gemini models via API Key. The specific models available may vary and are selectable in the UI (currently supports texty-standard).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   The PWA shall provide a text input area and an output area for enhanced text.
    *   The PWA shall have a responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
    *   The PWA shall provide clear loading and error indicators.
*   **Offline Functionality:**
    *   The PWA shall allow users to access recently enhanced texts offline. Enhanced texts are stored locally for offline access.
    *   The PWA shall queue text enhancement requests when offline and attempt to resubmit them when online. **Note:** The offline queue implementation is present in the service worker but may not be fully integrated into the main application logic. Further clarification is needed on the intended offline queue behavior.
    *   The PWA shall display a user-friendly offline page.
*   **Mobile Integration:**
    *   The PWA shall support the Web Share API for sharing text to Texty from other apps and sharing enhanced text from Texty to other apps on mobile devices.
    *   The PWA shall allow users to copy enhanced text to the clipboard.
    *   The PWA shall be installable as a PWA on mobile and desktop.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   The PWA shall use API Key-based authentication to access the Gemini API. Users need to provide their API key to use the text enhancement features. Google Sign-In is not currently implemented.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**
    *   Text enhancement should be performed quickly, ideally under 5 seconds for online requests.
    *   Offline access to cached texts should be instant.
    *   The PWA should be performant and responsive on a range of devices.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   The PWA should function reliably online and provide graceful offline degradation.
    *   Offline data (enhanced texts) should be persistent and available offline.  The syncing of offline enhancement requests is intended but requires further review.
*   **Usability:**
    *   The PWA should be easy to use and intuitive on both desktop and mobile.
    *   The UI should be clean, clear, and accessible.
*   **Security:**
    *   API keys are managed by the user and stored locally in the browser's local storage. Secure API key management practices should be documented in the deployment guide and user manual.
    *   User data (enhanced texts) is stored locally in the browser.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   The codebase should be modular and well-documented for future updates and maintenance.
    *   Service workers and caching strategies should be implemented for efficient updates.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   The PWA should be accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG guidelines where applicable.

## 4. External Interfaces

*   **Gemini API:** For AI-powered text enhancement.
*   **Cloudflare Pages:** For hosting and deployment.
*   **IndexedDB:** For offline data storage (`enhanced-texts` object store in `script.js` for enhanced texts, `offline-queue` object store in `sw.js` for potential offline requests queue). **Note:** Inconsistent usage of IndexedDB needs clarification.
*   **Web Share API:** For mobile sharing.

## 5. Constraints

*   The PWA should be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   Offline functionality is limited to cached enhanced texts and queuing of enhancement requests (queue implementation needs review).
*   API usage is subject to Gemini API limits.
