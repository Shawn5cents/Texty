# Test Plan: Texty - AI Text Enhancement PWA

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the Texty Progressive Web App (PWA), including unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and acceptance tests, with a focus on PWA-specific features.

## 2. Test Scope

The following components will be tested:

*   UI (index.html, script.js, offline.html)
*   Service Worker (sw.js)
*   Cloudflare Workers (api/)
*   IndexedDB integration
*   Web Share API integration
*   Gemini API integration

## 3. Test Types

### 3.1. Unit Tests

Unit tests will focus on individual components and functions:

*   JavaScript logic in `script.js` (enhancement options, UI interactions).
*   Cloudflare Workers functions (API request handling, security).
*   Service worker caching logic (sw.js).
*   IndexedDB data storage and retrieval functions.

### 3.2. Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify interactions between components:

*   UI and service worker interaction (caching, offline fallback).
*   UI and Cloudflare Workers API integration (text enhancement requests).
*   Service worker and IndexedDB integration (offline data persistence).
*   Web Share API integration with UI elements.

### 3.3. System Tests

System tests will evaluate the end-to-end functionality of the PWA:

*   Text enhancement workflow (input to enhanced output, online and offline).
*   PWA installation and "Add to Home Screen" functionality across browsers and devices.
*   Offline mode functionality and user experience.
*   Performance and responsiveness of the PWA under different network conditions.
*   Background sync and data consistency.
*   Error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

### 3.4. Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests will be performed from a user perspective:

*   Usability testing on different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
*   Testing with various text inputs and enhancement option combinations.
*   Testing PWA installability and app-like behavior.
*   Offline usage scenarios and cached content accessibility.
*   Performance and perceived speed of text enhancements.
*   User feedback collection and satisfaction assessment.

## 4. Test Environment

*   Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) - desktop and mobile.
*   Cloudflare Pages deployment environment.
*   Node.js and npm for local testing and build processes.
*   Testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, or similar) for unit and integration tests.
*   Mobile devices and emulators for mobile-specific testing.

## 5. Test Data

*   Diverse sample texts for text enhancement testing (various lengths, styles, and complexities).
*   Network conditions simulation for offline testing.
*   User accounts (if authentication is implemented for future features).

## 6. Test Schedule

*   **Phase 1: Unit Tests (1 week)**
*   **Phase 2: Integration Tests (1 week)**
*   **Phase 3: System Tests (1 week)**
*   **Phase 4: Acceptance Tests and User Feedback (1 week)**

    **Total Estimated Test Timeline: 4 weeks**
